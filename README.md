## Overview
The objective of this project is to draw insights based on the data available from Spotify and YouTube regarding artists, albums/tracks & some metrics through performing various SQL queries. The database consists of details such as track aspects (energy, danceability), streaming data, and YouTube video stats (collaboration views enjoyed comments). Here is an overview of how to write SQL queries and approaches at each complexity level for the goals in projects described earlier.

I haveve categorized it by three different levels of SQL query difficulty inside the project:

Beginner: Basic joins, some filters, and aggregations functions.
Intermediate: Complex queries on multiple tables and conditions.
Advanced: Analytical queries, e.g., performance metrics or rankings and multi-level aggregations.

The dataset consists of Spotify streams, track features (energy, danceability, etc.), YouTube views/likes/comments, and performance on different platforms for each track.
